The Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Compute Canada and Westgrid) is a provider of Advanced Research Computing infrastructure, including systems, storage and software.
The Alliance provides heterogeneous, general purpose clusters and Clouds that allow researchers to access resources such as CPU and GPU time, `software <http://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Available_software>`_, as well as different storage systems.

Procedure
~~~~~~~~~
You can apply for a Compute Canada account following `this documentation <http://computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account>`_

.. note:: 
   
   * If you are a PI, please create an account as other lab members must be sponsored under your account.
   * If you are a lab member, contact your PI for their Compute Canada Role Identifier (CCRI) so that you can complete your application. Your PI must then confirm your role for your account to be created.
