HPC Working Environments
========================

Instructions and recommendations on setting up your working environments and workflows on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems such as:

* Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Compute Canada and Westgrid clusters)

These systems use similar software configurations. Where procedures differ between systems, this will be indicated. Otherwise, a generalized approach will be used in the documentation that follows. 

This documentation was written to accommodate users on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, MacOS and Linux distributions. Corrections, further documentation, feedback and other contributions are highly welcomed.
